## Abstract
This paper introduces GraphWave, a dynamic context-adaptive framework that enhances the recognition rate of malicious behaviors through multimodal feature fusion. Firstly, by jointly analyzing the attacker context, target context, and temporal context, we dynamically identify key sessions and construct a maximum connected subgraph. This enables us to precisely focus on the traffic relevant to the current session. Secondly, we integrate the wavelet transform with a dynamic graph attention network to create an adaptive graph structure and extract inter-flow spatial context features. Thirdly, we utilize a temporal transformer encoder with position encoding to decode byte-level sequences, thereby capturing long-range intra-flow temporal dependencies. Finally, we employ a multimodal cross-attention fusion mechanism to learn the hierarchical feature interactions between context and temporal representations. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets reveal that GraphWave attains a 99.13% F1 score in threat detection, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods by an average of 7.62%.
