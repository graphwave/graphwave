## Abstract
Accurate network traffic classification is crucial to protect network systems from evolving threats. Most existing methods rely on intra-flow features to identify malicious behaviors. However, the intra-flow features of some malicious behaviors are difficult to distinguish from legitimate behaviors. Although existing graph neural network-based methods can capture contextual dependencies, the static graphs they construct struggle to adapt to the temporal evolution characteristics of network traffic. This paper introduces GraphWave, a dynamic context-adaptive framework that enhances the recognition rate of malicious behaviors through multimodal feature fusion. Firstly, by jointly analyzing the attacker context, target context, and temporal context, we dynamically identify key sessions and construct a maximum connected subgraph. This enables us to precisely focus on the traffic relevant to the current session. Secondly, we integrate the wavelet transform with a dynamic graph attention network to create an adaptive graph structure and extract inter-flow spatial context features. Thirdly, we utilize a temporal transformer encoder with position encoding to decode byte-level sequences, thereby capturing long-range intra-flow temporal dependencies. Finally, we employ a multimodal cross-attention fusion mechanism to learn the hierarchical feature interactions between context and temporal representations. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets reveal that GraphWave attains a 99.13\% F1 score in threat detection, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods by an average of 7.62\%. Additionally, we conduct a series of experiments to showcase the robustness and stability of our approach under scenarios such as traffic obfuscation, temporal confusion, and high intra-flow similarity.
